# Prediction Market Based Trading

## Aim

Employ PM concepts to create trading strategies (using estimize data)

## Tasks

1. Create the code to automate the stock selection (might use estimize API):
    
    * Get list of all stocks in estimize
    * Get stock price data [daily] for these stocks (<b> source? </b>)
    * Create checks using estimize data:
        
        a. Create check based on how many times the estimize beat wall street

        b. Create check using the expiry data data from estimize and stock data to calculate the percentage of times the stock respond correctly to predictions

        c. Calculate and save the score for each of them

        d. Code to remind me (message me) about upcoming results of the stocks of interest (<b> source? </b>)
